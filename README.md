### Assets

Key Assets include:

#### Art
All the art created in the game is original and designed by me. This folder contains the sprites, shapes and designs used throughout the entire game.

#### Audio
All the audio is from freesound.org, a collaborative database of Creative Commons Licensed sounds. Each .wav file can be found in this folder.

#### Scripts
Scripts are all the coded components of the app. This folder includes:
* M_Enemy, which handles the functions of the enemies in the game. 
* M_MovingEnemy, which handles movements and motions of the moving enemies
* M_LM, a local manager that controls the logistics of each level (how many tokens have been collected, status of completion, etc.)
* M_MainMenu, which codes the title screen
* M_Player, which handles all functions and behaviours of the player, including moving around and switching gravity. 
* M_Token, which handles all functions of the token, which must be collected by the player. 
* M_Trophy, which handles all functions of the trophy
* M_TimeManager, which controls the time-limit element in future levels
