# OG SWITCH
## Amethyst McKenzie

OG Switch allows you to switch the direction of gravity in order to complete each level.
With new challenges to face each time--including moving enemies, tokens, and a timing component--and modern graphics!

Game Features:
- Gravity-switching
- Moving and stationary enemies
- Tokens 
- Timed levels!

I can't upload the entire Unity game to github (it's too large) but feel free to check it out on the app store! Just look for "OG Switch" :)
